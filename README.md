# Enhanced Emotional Speech Data Generation

This project focuses on generating and analyzing emotional speech data using advanced techniques. It is designed to support research and development in the field of speech emotion recognition, synthesis, and augmentation.

## Features
- Generation of synthetic emotional speech data
- Analysis and visualization of emotional speech features
- Support for multiple emotions and speech styles
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation

## Project Structure
- `Enhanced Emotional Speech Data Generation.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, experiments, and documentation.
- `electronics.pdf`: Reference or supplementary material (if applicable).

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open `Enhanced Emotional Speech Data Generation.ipynb`.
3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required packages (see the first cell of the notebook for details).

## Usage
- Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to generate and analyze emotional speech data.
- Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different emotions or data generation techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Additional Python packages as specified in the notebook
